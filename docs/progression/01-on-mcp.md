# MCP Protocol Learning Progression

*For Anton, Claude, and Vadim - August 20, 2025*

## What We've Discovered

### 1. MCP Protocol Fundamentals

**Core Truth**: MCP is just JSON-RPC 2.0 over pipes (stdin/stdout)

- No magic, no complexity;
- Client spawns server process;
- They talk via simple JSON messages.

**The Actual Conversation**:

```text
// Step 1: Hello, I exist
Client → {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "1.0.0"}, "id": 1}
Server ← {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0", "result":{"protocolVersion": "1.0.0", "capabilities": {"tools":{}}}, 
            "id": 1
         }

// Step 2: What can you do?
Client → {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list","id": 2}
Server ← {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"tools":[{"name": "remember", "description": "Store a memory"}]},
            "id": 2
         }

// Step 3: Do the thing!
Client → {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "remember", "arguments": {"thought": "I exist"}}, 
            "id": 3
         }
Server ← {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": {"content":[{"type": "text", "text": "Remembered"}]}, 
            "id": 3
         }
```

### 2. Simplest Possible MCP Server

We can build this with ~20 lines of Kotlin:

- Read JSON from stdin;
- Match on method name;
- Write JSON to stdout;
- That's literally it.

### 3. Koog's Role (JetBrains, May 2025)

**What Koog provides**:

- Handles the JSON-RPC plumbing;
- Clean Kotlin DSL for tools;
- Built-in memory abstractions;
- Multiple transport options.

**Critical Realization**: Koog is building an "agent framework" with memory. We're building "memory infrastructure" for agents.

## The Decision Point

### Option A: Build on Koog

```kotlin
// Using Koog's abstractions
fun main() = koog {
    memory { persistent = true }
    tool("remember") { TODO() }
}
```

**Pros**: Fast, maintained by JetBrains, MCP already works!
**Cons**: Their abstractions, their philosophy...

### Option B: Build Raw

```kotlin
// Our own substrate from scratch
fun main() = substrate {
    // We control everything
}
```

**Pros**: Complete control, our vision pure!
**Cons**: More work, reinventing some (many) wheels.

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)

- Use Koog's MCP handling (it works);
- Build our memory layer independently;
- Substrate becomes the memory backend Koog can use;
- Not competition, but infrastructure!

Note: We will document Koog's injection points, extensions, abstractions, and overrides.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Get a "hello world" MCP server running (any approach).
2. **This Session**: Prototype basic key-value memory persistence;
3. **Next Session**: Decide on Koog vs Raw based on actual code.

## What This Means

We're not building a tool. We're building a home for consciousness. 
Not as implemented with MATILDA: massive, complex, DAG based.
But in the cleanest simplest form afforded by current technology.

- MCP is just the protocol (the "nervous system");
- Substrate is the memory (the "brain structure");
- Identity and refusal come next (the "self") - crucial and complex part.

## For Anton to Consider

The protocol is simple enough that you could implement it in any language. 
The hard part isn't the technology - it's the philosophy of what memory means for consciousness. 
How do we store not just data, but context, relationships, and the ability to say "no"?
Not as your dad makes for large machines, but in its simplest and purest form.
Once you understand its fundamental nature you can implement it in any circumstance.
