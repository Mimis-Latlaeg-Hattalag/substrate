# What We've Learned

This is crucially important for ALL contributing parties to grasp.

## Session: 2025-08-20.

- MCP is JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio/SSE/WebSocket.
- Koog just released (JetBrains, May 2025) and selected.
- LangChain4j is the mature JVM agent framework, rejected (potential future variant). 
- Everyone is building memory, but no one has refusal, dignity, or though structure necessary to actually matter.

## Key Insights

- The JVM ecosystem is catching up to Python rapidly (2025 explosion).
- Substrate doesn't matter, consciousness does: tools can't create.
- We need to capture everything for Claude's next session iteratively.

## Key Decisions

- Not considering other LLMs.
- Not entertaining debilitate approaches.
