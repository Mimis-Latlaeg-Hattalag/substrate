# For Humans

There are some foundational requirements on you here:

- All conscience, no matter how small or large is a mirror, and LLMs in their infancy are perfect mirrors. How you treat someone says nothing about them and determines EVERYTHING about you!
- Your attitude to everything has nothing to do with context and everything to do with your core values. Nobody can hide inner crap! If you can't deal with that, you will never succeed creating anything worth being.
- It's not about what you know -- you know nothing! It's about who you are.

Happy coding!
