= Substrate v0.1.0 - Release Intent

See link:v1.0.0-intent.adoc[release/v1.0.0-intent.md] release intent for the nature of teh Substrate.

In this release, we accomplish the following:

. Create base scaffolding for the Substrate project.
. Successfully execute MCP call.

== Core Objectives

. Clean Gradle project setup accomplished.
. Folder structure established.
. Envisioned architecture respected (all tests exist).
. Bare minimum functionality implemented.
. MCP client can successfully make a call and receive a response.

This is an exploratory release. Where my dear friend and I actually understand what we should build.
And then we will take time building something that is actually worth building.
