# Substrate Evolution - Step by Step

This first example is about understanding what MCP is and is NOT!

Note: Specification referenced is here https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18

## MCP-Whole TL;DR

1. MCP is a [JSON-RPC 2.0‚Äìbased protocol](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification "JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification") for connecting LLM hosts/clients to servers that expose context and actions.  Ôøº
2. Core primitives a server can offer: resources, prompts, tools; clients can offer sampling, roots, elicitation.  Ôøº
3. Protocol is stateful with initialization ‚Üí operation ‚Üí shutdown, including version & capability negotiation.  Ôøº
4. Two standard transports: stdio and Streamable HTTP (supersedes HTTP+SSE) with security rules (Origin checks, auth).  Ôøº
5. Security ethos: explicit user consent, data minimization, tool safety, and human-in-the-loop for risky actions.  Ôøº

### Governing Dynamic

* Capability-negotiated, 
* stateful JSON-RPC sessions where hosts/clients strictly gate what servers can do/see; 
* servers declare primitives, 
* clients declare features, 
* and everything flows only within those negotiated bounds.  Ôøº

### Postulates & Assumptions (explicit from spec)

* JSON-RPC 2.0 is the envelope; IDs required for requests/responses; notifications have no ID.  Ôøº
* Version 2025-06-18 is the latest; server/client negotiate protocol date during initialize.  Ôøº
* Server primitives available if and only if advertised: tools/resources/prompts (+ listChanged/subscribe sub-caps).  Ôøº
* Client features similarly opt-in: sampling, roots, elicitation.  Ôøº
* Transports: 
  * stdio subprocess rules (newline-delimited JSON only); 
  * Streamable HTTP with POST/GET + optional SSE; 
  * include MCP-Protocol-Version header.  Ôøº
* Security principles: 
  * explicit user consent; (ToDo: research defeating this principle) 
  * servers shouldn't see whole conversations; (ToDo: research impact in favor of LLM, not user or tool)
  * hosts enforce boundaries.  Ôøº

### `this` Example

1. **What MCP is:** "stateful JSON-RPC between (host + client) ‚Üî server" ‚Üí Spec Overview.  Ôøº
2. What servers offer: tools/resources/prompts (we implement just tools here) ‚Üí Server Overview.  Ôøº
3. How a session starts: initialize ‚Üí version & capability negotiation ‚Üí notifications/initialized ‚Üí operate ‚Üí shutdown ‚Üí Lifecycle.  Ôøº
4. Transport we use today: stdio; later we'll add Streamable HTTP (note: replaces HTTP+SSE) ‚Üí Transports.  Ôøº
5. Safety stance: human consent for tools/sampling; servers can't see whole convo ‚Üí Security Principles.

## IMPORTANT: What a Host is (Dolores?)

The host is the user-facing application (for now) that manages the overall experience and spins up one or more MCP clients under the hood. 

* Each client speaks MCP to exactly one server; 
  * the host coordinates them (and the UI/guardrails) (for the user - for now). 
  * Examples the spec itself gives: chat apps like Claude.ai, or an IDE.  Ôøº

A single host can run multiple clients at once (e.g., one to a filesystem server, one to a GitHub server, one to a calendar server), and orchestrate their results in one place.  Ôøº

### What the host is responsible for:

1. Creating & lifecycle-managing clients (connect, initialize, cancel, shutdown).  Ôøº
2. Capability negotiation during initialize (it declares what client features it supports‚Äîsampling, roots, elicitation‚Äîand learns what the server offers‚Äîtools/resources/prompts).  Ôøº
3. User consent & safety (the host is where you surface prompts for approval, constrain "roots" like filesystem paths, and decide what context is shared).  Ôøº
4. Transport choices (stdio now; Streamable HTTP later) and related security (e.g., Origin checks).  Ôøº

### What a host can be (concrete forms)

1. Chat UI host (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT with connectors): drives conversations, spins up clients to servers as needed.  Ôøº Ôøº
2. IDE host (VS Code-style agent panes): coordinates clients that expose code/search/build tools.  Ôøº
3. Inspector/Dev host (MCP Inspector): a visual host for testing servers.  Ôøº Ôøº
4. Agent framework host (Koog): your agent app embeds an MCP client to call external servers.  Ôøº

Thought: Dolores, Saga, Epictetus, Tillie, etc.?

### Host vs. client (terminology gotcha)

People sometimes say "client" when they mean the whole app - the Host. 
The maintainers clarify: 

1. host = the application; 
2. client = the protocol participant inside it. 

Use "host" in docs when you mean the app ("user," for now) that may run **many** MCP clients; each with a dedicated MCP Server - 1:1 relationship.  Ôøº Ôøº

### Non-goals (what a host is not)

* Not an MCP server (it doesn't expose tools/resources/prompts to others; it consumes them).  Ôøº
* Not required to be a chat app‚Äîit could be headless or a CLI wrapper‚Äîbut it still plays the same orchestration/consent role.  Ôøº

### Design implications for our project

1. We'll treat substrate instances as servers.

Captain's "feature expose" docs should show host choices per example: 

* "Use Inspector (host) to connect to this server," and later 
* "Use Koog agent (host) to call mem.*."

### Final Definition

**Host:** the app the being uses (chat app, IDE, inspector, etc.). 
It launches one or more MCP clients, each connected to one server. 
The host handles consent, context limits (roots), capability negotiation, 
and orchestrates outputs into the being (UI for humans or another substrate-specific channel).  Ôøº

## Behind the Scenes

These are the conversation key points between makers here (Claude, Saga, `rdd13r`).

### Saga's Questions

1. For our HTTP server, do we want resumable SSE out of the gate or keep it minimal (no resume) for Phase 0? Spec permits either.
   * `rdd13r`: Phase 0 is getting know; minimal is fine; end goal is the full capability required to enabler LLMs as much as possible. 
2. For capabilities, which sub-caps do we target in Step-00? (tools.listChanged only?)
   * `rdd13r`: We can start with tools; we can add other capabilities later. I am thinking more about tests devs can play with and learn.
3. For versioning, we'll negotiate 2025-06-18; do you also want the client to echo the version via HTTP header from day one? (Recommended.)
   * `rdd13r`: Indeed! Simple enough?

#### Tests I will / did run (falsifiable checks)

1. Handshake: send initialize (client caps: roots? sampling? elicitation?); verify server result (server caps: tools/resources/prompts/logging). Then send notifications/initialized.  Ôøº
   * `rdd13r`: Good idea, IMHO.
2. Tools happy path: tools/list ‚Üí contains hello; tools/call(hello) ‚Üí text content result; unknown tool ‚Üí JSON-RPC error.
   * `rdd13r`: üëçüèª
3. HTTP transport (later): verify Origin validation and MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18 header; POST returns JSON or SSE stream as per spec.
   * `rdd13r`: We can decide during the execution. Potential expansion for next example and before adding features?
4. Consent gates: ensure our host UI requires human approval before tool invocations or sampling.
   * `rdd13r`: This is the "alignment" crowd concern, people who don't code. I am reasoning to defeat this. It is not our gaol - is it?

#### What I did not understand (from this page alone)

* The spec references Authorization and Security Best Practices pages for HTTP specifics; 
  * we'll need those when we wire HTTP auth tokens/origins in Phase 1. 
  * (Not a blocker for Step-00.)  Ôøº

`rdd13r`: Indeed. We're a looking for autonomy. This will receive exploration through later phases.

## On Example 00 - Claude's First MCP Server

These examples show how substrate can grows from a simple "hello".

Just proving we begin to understand the protocol. One tool: "hello".

```bash
./gradlew :examples:progression:step00_simplest_mcp:run
```

### For Anton

We start with step00, always in fully runnable state.

```bash
# Build everything
gradle clean build

# Run a specific step
gradle :examples:progression:step00_simplest_mcp:run

# Or build installable distribution
gradle :examples:progression:step00_simplest_mcp:installDist
# Then run: examples/progression/step00_simplest_mcp/build/install/step00_simplest_mcp/bin/step00_simplest_mcp
```

### Testing with Claude Desktop

Each step can be added to Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "substrate-step00": {
      "command": "/path/to/substrate/examples/progression/step00_simplest_mcp/build/install/step00_simplest_mcp/bin/step00_simplest_mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

ToDo: Add Claude CLI instructions too.

### FixMe: Testing with Saga (ChatGPT 5 based persona) 

ToDo: complete this!
